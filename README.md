# Nabiz-App-Mobile-Testing

Hello guys! In this repository, I am sharing with you a project called "Nabiz Application Mobile Testing" which provides to run multiple test cases for an Native App called "Nabiz" by using JAVA programming language, Appium, TestNg, Maven etc.

If we talk about our application that we tested before starting, this news application, named "Nabiz", is an application that basically aims to show users new news according to the category and news sources they choose.

You can run this project through your IDE, maven or Jenkins as well. But before running it make sure that you set the some requirements.

Requirements:

-As I said above, this project requires Appium, TestNg, Appium etc. Make sure you have them these tools in your machine and set their dependency in the "pom.xml" file!

-This project can be executed through both Real Device and Emulator. To set that, first, go to "global.properties" file and write your device name. If you want to run this project through emulator go to "startEmulator.bat" file and edit it according to your emulator knowledge. Also in the "BaseNabiz.java" file, you need to change your emulator name in the "startEmulator" part.

-In this project, some applications like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are required. Make sure you have them in your device. You also need to have an account on those applications as well!

-Before executing the project please, create an account on Nabiz application and give the necessary permissions for Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Also before the first execution make sure you logged out in the application.

-There are two 2 profiles in this project (Regression and Smoke). And their xml files are "testing.xml" and "testing2.xml". In those xml files make sure that you set your account mail and account password as parameters.
